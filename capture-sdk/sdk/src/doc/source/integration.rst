Integration
===========

Android Manifest
----------------

The Gini Capture SDK uses the camera therefore the camera permission is required:

.. code-block:: xml

    <manifest xmlns:android="http://schemas.android.com/apk/res/android"
        package="...">
        
        <uses-permission android:name="android.permission.CAMERA" />

    </manifest>

.. note::

    Make sure you request the camera permission before starting the SDK.

Requirements Check
------------------

We recommend running our runtime requirements check first before launching the Gini Capture SDK to ensure the device is
capable of taking pictures of adequate quality.

Simply run ``GiniCaptureRequirements.checkRequirements()`` and inspect the returned ``RequirementsReport`` for the result:

.. note::

    On Android 6.0 and later the camera permission is required before checking the requirements.

.. code-block:: java

    final RequirementsReport report = GiniCaptureRequirements.checkRequirements(this);
    if (!report.isFulfilled()) {
        final StringBuilder stringBuilder = new StringBuilder();
        report.getRequirementReports().forEach(requirementReport -> {
            if (!requirementReport.isFulfilled()) {
                stringBuilder.append(requirementReport.getRequirementId());
                stringBuilder.append(": ");
                stringBuilder.append(requirementReport.getDetails());
                stringBuilder.append("\n");
            }
        });
        Toast.makeText(this, "Requirements not fulfilled:\n" + stringBuilder,
                Toast.LENGTH_LONG).show();
    }

Configuration
-------------

Configuration and interaction is done using the ``GiniCapture`` singleton.

To configure and create a new instance use the ``GiniCapture.Builder`` returned by ``GiniCapture.newInstance()``. The
builder creates a new ``GiniCapture`` singleton which you will need to destroy later with ``GiniCapture.getInstance().cleanup()``.
This will also free up any used resources.

You should call ``cleanup()`` after the SDK returned control to your application and your app has sent feedback to the
Gini Bank API and is not using the SDK anymore.

To view all the configuration options see the documentation of :root_dokka_path:`GiniCapture.Builder
<sdk/net.gini.android.capture/-gini-capture/-builder/index.html?query=public%20class%20Builder>`.

Information about the configurable features are available on the `Features <features.html>`_ page.

Tablet Support
---------------

The Gini Capture SDK can be used on tablets, too. Some UI elements adapt to the larger screen to offer the best user
experience for tablet users.

Many tablets with at least 8MP cameras don't have an LED flash. Therefore we don't require flash for tablets. For this
reason the extraction quality on those tablets might be lower compared to smartphones.

On tablets landscape orientation is also supported (smartphones are portrait only). We advise you to test your
integration on tablets in both orientations.

In landscape the camera screen's UI displays the camera trigger button on the right side of the screen. Users
can reach the camera trigger more easily this way. The camera preview along with the document corner guides are shown in
landscape to match the device's orientation.

Other UI elements on all the screens maintain their relative position and the screen layouts are scaled automatically to
fit the current orientation.

Networking
----------

Communication with the Gini Bank API is not part of the Gini Capture SDK in order to allow you the freedom to use a
networking implementation of your own choosing.

.. note::

    You should have received Gini Bank API client credentials from us. Please get in touch with us in case you donâ€™t have
    them. Without credentials you won't be able to use the Gini Bank API.

We provide two interfaces which need to be implemented to enable the SDK to analyze documents and retrieve extractions:

* ``GiniCaptureNetworkService``
   This interface is used to upload, analyze and delete documents. See the 
   :root_dokka_path:`reference documentation <sdk/net.gini.android.capture.network/-gini-capture-network-service/index.html>`
   for details.

* ``GiniCaptureNetworkApi``
   This interface is used to declare network tasks which should be called by you outside of the Gini Capture SDK (e.g.,
   for sending feedback after the user saw and potentielly corrected the extractions).  See the
   :root_dokka_path:`reference documentation
   <sdk/net.gini.android.capture.network/-gini-capture-network-api/index.html>` for details.

Default Implementation
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

The quickest way to add networking is to use the `Gini Capture Network
Library <https://github.com/gini/gini-mobile-android/tree/main/capture-sdk/default-network>`_.

To use it add the ``gini-capture-network-lib`` dependency to your app's ``build.gradle``:

.. code-block:: groovy

    dependencies {
        ...
        implementation 'net.gini.android:gini-capture-sdk-default-network:1.11.3'
    }

For the Gini Capture SDK to be aware of the default implementations create the instances and pass
them to the builder of ``GiniCapture``:

.. code-block:: java

    GiniCaptureDefaultNetworkService networkService = 
        GiniCaptureDefaultNetworkService.builder((Context) this)
            .setClientCredentials(myClientId, myClientSecret, myEmailDomain)
            .build();

    GiniCaptureDefaultNetworkApi networkApi = 
        GiniCaptureDefaultNetworkApi.builder()
            .withGiniCaptureDefaultNetworkService(networkService)
            .build();

    GiniCapture.newInstance()
        .setGiniCaptureNetworkService(networkService)
        .setGiniCaptureNetworkApi(networkApi)
        .build();

Both default implementations follow the builder pattern. See the documentation of
:root_dokka_path_default_network_library:`GiniCaptureDefaultNetworkService.Builder <default-network/net.gini.android.capture.network/-gini-capture-default-network-service/-builder/index.html>`
and :root_dokka_path_default_network_library:`GiniCaptureDefaultNetworkApi.Builder <default-network/net.gini.android.capture.network/-gini-capture-default-network-api/-builder/index.html>`
for configuration options.

Retrieve the Analyzed Document
^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^

You can call ``GiniCaptureDefaultNetworkService.getAnalyzedGiniApiDocument()`` after the Gini Capture SDK has returned
extractions to your application. It returns the Gini Bank API document which was created when the user uploaded an
image or pdf for analysis.

When extractions were retrieved without using the Gini Bank API, then it will return ``null``. For example when the
extractions came from an EPS QR Code.

.. note::

    Make sure to call it before calling ``GiniCaptureDefaultNetworkService.cleanup()`` or ``GiniCapture.cleanup()``.
    Otherwise the analyzed document won't be available anymore.


Custom Implementation
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

You can also provide your own networking by implementing the ``GiniCaptureNetworkService`` and the
``GiniCaptureNetworkApi`` interfaces. Pass your instances to the builder of ``GiniCapture`` as shown
above.

You may also use the `Gini Bank API Library <https://github.com/gini/gini-mobile-android/bank-api-library>`_ for Android or implement
communication with the Gini Bank API yourself.

Sending Feedback
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

Your app should send feedback for the extractions the Gini Bank API delivered. Feedback should be sent *only* for the
extractions the user has seen and accepted (or corrected).

For additional information about feedback see the `Gini Bank API documentation
<https://pay-api.gini.net/documentation/#send-feedback-and-get-even-better-extractions-next-time>`_.

Default Implementation
^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^

The example below shows how to correct extractions and send feedback using the default networking implementation:

.. note::

    We also provide a sample test case `here
    <https://github.com/gini/gini-mobile-android/blob/main/capture-sdk/default-network/src/androidTest/java/net/gini/android/capture/network/ExtractionFeedbackIntegrationTest.kt>`_
    to verify that extraction feedback sending works. You may use it along with the example pdf and json files as a
    starting point to write your own test case.

    The sample test case is based on the Bank API documentation's `recommended steps
    <https://pay-api.gini.net/documentation/#test-example>`_ for testing extraction feedback sending.

.. code-block:: java

   GiniCaptureDefaultNetworkApi networkApi; // Provided

   Map<String, GiniCaptureSpecificExtraction> extractions; // Provided

   // Modify the amount to pay extraction's value.
   GiniCaptureSpecificExtraction amountToPay = extractions.get("amountToPay");
   amountToPay.setValue("31:00");

   // You should send feedback only for extractions the user has seen and accepted.
   // In this example only the amountToPay was wrong and we can reuse the other extractions.
   Map<String, GiniCaptureSpecificExtraction> feedback = new HashMap<String, GiniCaptureSpecificExtraction>();
   feedback.put("iban", extractions.get("iban"));
   feedback.put("amountToPay", amountToPay);
   feedback.put("bic", extractions.get("bic"));
   feedback.put("senderName", extractions.get("senderName"));

   networkApi.sendFeedback(feedback, new GiniCaptureNetworkCallback<Void, Error>() {
            @Override
            public void failure(Error error) {
                // Handle the error.
            }

            @Override
            public void success(Void result) {
                // Feedback sent successfully.
            }

            @Override
            public void cancelled() {
                // Handle cancellation.
            }
        });

Custom Implementation
^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^

If you use your own networking implementation and directly communicate with the Gini Bank API then see `this section
<https://pay-api.gini.net/documentation/#submitting-feedback-on-extractions>`_ in its documentation on how to send
feedback.

In case you use the Gini Bank API Library then see `this section
<https://developer.gini.net/gini-mobile-android/bank-api-library/library/html/guides/common-tasks.html#sending-feedback>`_ in its documentation
for details.

.. note::

    The Bank API documentation provides `recommended steps <https://pay-api.gini.net/documentation/#test-example>`_ for
    testing extraction feedback sending. You may use it along with the example pdf and json files as a starting point to
    write a test case for verifying that feedback sending works. 

Capturing documents
-------------------

To launch the Gini Capture SDK you only need to:

#. Request camera access,
#. Configure a new instance of ``GiniCapture``,
#. Launch the ``CameraActivity``,
#. Handle the result.

The following diagram shows the interaction between your app and the SDK:

.. figure:: _static/integration/Screen-API.png
   :alt: Diagram of interaction between your app and the SDK
   :width: 100%

.. note::

   Check out the `example app
   <https://github.com/gini/gini-mobile-android/tree/main/capture-sdk/screen-api-example-app>`_ to see how an integration could look
   like.

The ``CameraActivity`` can return with the following result codes:

* Activity.RESULT_OK

   Document was analyzed and the extractions are available in the ``EXTRA_OUT_EXTRACTIONS`` result extra. It contains a
   ``Bundle`` with the extraction labels as keys and ``GiniCaptureSpecificExtraction`` parcelables as values.

* Activity.RESULT_CANCELED
   
   User has canceled the Gini Capture SDK.

* CameraActivity.RESULT_ERROR

   An error occured and the details are available in the ``EXTRA_OUT_ERROR`` result extra. It contains a parcelable extra
   of type ``GiniCaptureError`` detailing what went wrong.

The following example shows how to launch the Gini Capture SDK and how to handle the results:

.. code-block:: java

    void launchGiniCapture() {
        // Make sure camera permission has been already granted at this point.
        
        // Check that the device fulfills the requirements.
        RequirementsReport report = GiniCaptureRequirements.checkRequirements((Context) this);
        if (!report.isFulfilled()) {
            handleUnfulfilledRequirements(report);
            return;
        }
        
        // Instantiate the networking implementations.
        GiniCaptureNetworkService networkService = ...
        GiniCaptureNetworkApi networkApi = ...

        // Cleanup GiniCapture to make sure everything is reset.
        GiniCapture.cleanup((Context) this);
        
        // Configure GiniCapture and create a new singleton instance.
        GiniCapture.newInstance()
                .setGiniCaptureNetworkService(networkService)
                .setGiniCaptureNetworkApi(networkApi)
                ...
                .build();
                
        // Launch the CameraActivity and wait for the result.
        Intent intent = new Intent(this, CameraActivity.class);
        startActivityForResult(intent, GINI_CAPTURE_REQUEST);
    }

    @Override
    protected void onActivityResult(final int requestCode, final int resultCode,
            final Intent data) {
        super.onActivityResult(requestCode, resultCode, data);

        if (requestCode == GINI_CAPTURE_REQUEST) {
            switch (resultCode) {
                case Activity.RESULT_CANCELED:
                    break;

                case Activity.RESULT_OK:
                    // Retrieve the extractions
                    Bundle extractionsBundle = data.getBundleExtra(
                            CameraActivity.EXTRA_OUT_EXTRACTIONS);
                    
                    // Retrieve the extractions from the extractionsBundle
                    Map<String, GiniCaptureSpecificExtraction> extractions = new HashMap<>();
                    for (String extractionLabel : extractionsBundle.keySet()) {
                        GiniCaptureSpecificExtraction extraction = extractionsBundle.getParcelable(extractionLabel);
                        extractions.put(extractionLabel, extraction);
                    }
                    handleExtractions(extractions);

                    break;

                case CameraActivity.RESULT_ERROR:
                    // Something went wrong, retrieve and handle the error
                    final GiniCaptureError error = data.getParcelableExtra(
                            CameraActivity.EXTRA_OUT_ERROR);
                    if (error != null) {
                        handleError(error);
                    }

                    break;
            }
        }
    }
