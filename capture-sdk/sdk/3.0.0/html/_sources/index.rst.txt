Gini Capture SDK for Android
============================

Introduction
------------

The Gini Capture SDK for Android provides Activities and Fragments to capture documents and prepare them for upload to
the Gini Bank API. It also allows documents to be imported from other apps. The captured images can be reviewed and are
optimized on the device to provide the best results when used with the Gini Bank API.

The Gini Bank API provides an information extraction service for analyzing documents (e.g. invoices or contracts).
Specifically it extracts information such as the document sender or the payment relevant information (amount to pay,
IBAN, etc.) in an invoice.

.. note::
   The documentation for the 2.x.x version can be found `here <https://developer.gini.net/gini-mobile-android/capture-sdk/sdk/2.0.2/html/index.html>`_.
