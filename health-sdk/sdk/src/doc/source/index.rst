Gini Health SDK for Android
=================================

The Gini Health SDK for Android provides all the UI and functionality needed to use the Gini Pay API in your app to
extract payment and health information from invoices. The payment information can be reviewed and then the invoice can
be paid using any available payment provider app (e.g., banking app).

The Gini Pay API provides an information extraction service for analyzing health invoices. Specifically, it extracts
information such as the document sender or the payment relevant information (amount to pay, IBAN, etc.). In addition it
also provides a secure channel for sharing payment related information between clients.
