Customization
=============

Customization is achieved through Android's resourcing system.
This means that all `resources of the library <https://github.com/gini/gini-mobile-android/tree/main/health-sdk/sdk/src/main/res>`_
can be overridden by providing resources with the same name in the
application.

When overriding the Health SDK's
`styles <https://github.com/gini/gini-mobile-android/blob/main/health-sdk/sdk/src/main/res/values/styles.xml>`_
make sure to keep their name and parent style the same. You can see examples
of overridden styles in the
`example app <https://github.com/gini/gini-mobile-android/blob/main/health-sdk/example-app/src/main/res/values/styles.xml>`_.

Material components are used in the ReviewFragment and those components will pick attributes of the hosting activity
if it uses a material theme.

Dark Mode
---------

To enable and customise dark mode you will need to do the following:

#. Set the parent of the ``Root.GiniHealth`` style to a DayNight theme as described
   `here <https://developer.android.com/guide/topics/ui/look-and-feel/darktheme#support-dark-theme>`_:

   .. code-block:: xml

       <style name="Root.GiniHealth" parent="Theme.MaterialComponents.DayNight"/>

#. Override the Gini Health SDKâ€™s
   `styles <https://github.com/gini/gini-mobile-android/blob/main/health-sdk/sdk/src/main/res/values/styles.xml>`_,
   `colors <https://github.com/gini/gini-mobile-android/blob/main/health-sdk/sdk/src/main/res/values/colors.xml>`_
   and icons for dark mode in night-qualified resource directories (i.e., ``values-night``).
