Since `July 20, 2022 <https://support.google.com/googleplay/android-developer/answer/10787469?hl=en>`_, Google requires
all apps published via the Google Play Store to declare how their app collects and handles user data. This document
provides information about the Gini Health SDK's data use to help you fill out or update your app's `Data safety
form <https://developer.android.com/privacy-and-security/declare-data-use>`_ for the Google Play Store.

Data collection and security
----------------------------

For the question **“Does your app collect or share any of the required user data types?”** please answer **Yes**. Gini
Health SDK collects information about purchases and transactions.

For the questions **“Is all of the user data collected by your app encrypted in transit?“** please answer **Yes.** Gini
Health SDK transmits data only via https and in addition you can also use certificate pinning.

The answer to the question **“Do you provide a way for users to request that their data is deleted?“** depends on
whether you provide your users a way to request data deletion. If you do, then you can contact Gini support or use the
Gini Pay API to delete user data.
