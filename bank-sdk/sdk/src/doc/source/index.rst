Gini Bank SDK for Android
=========================

Introduction
------------

The Gini Bank SDK for Android provides all the UI and functionality needed to use the Gini Bank API in your app to
extract payment information from invoices and to resolve payment requests originating from other apps.

The Gini Bank API provides an information extraction service for analyzing invoices. Specifically it extracts information
such as the document sender or the payment relevant information (amount to pay, IBAN, etc.). In addition it also
provides a secure channel for sharing payment related information between clients.
