Gini Bank API Library for Android
===================================

Introduction
------------

The Gini Bank API Library for Android encapsulates the Gini Bank API to allow you to easily integrate it into your
app.

The Gini Bank API provides an information extraction service for analyzing invoices. Specifically, it extracts
information such as the document sender or the payment relevant information (amount to pay, IBAN, etc.). In addition it
also provides a secure channel for sharing payment related information between clients.
