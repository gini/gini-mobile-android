Gini Health API Library for Android
===================================

Introduction
------------

The Gini Health API Library for Android encapsulates the Gini Health API to allow you to easily integrate it into your
app.

The Gini Health API provides an information extraction service for analyzing health invoices. Specifically, it extracts
information such as the document sender or the payment relevant information (amount to pay, IBAN, etc.). In addition it
also provides a secure channel for sharing payment related information between clients.
